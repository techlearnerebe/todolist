Task lists in issues, comments, and pull request descriptions are incredibly useful for project coordination and keeping track of important items. Starting today, we are adding read-only task lists to all Markdown documents in repositories and wikis. So now, when you write:

### Solar System Exploration, 1950s – 1960s

- [ ] Mercury
- [x] Venus
- [x] Earth (Orbit/Moon)
- [x] Mars
- [ ] Jupiter
- [ ] Saturn
- [ ] Uranus
- [ ] Neptune
- [ ] Comet Haley
It will render like this, everywhere on GitHub:

Solar System Exploration, 1950s â€“ 1960s

Edit the document or wiki page and use the - [ ] and - [x] syntax to update your task list.
